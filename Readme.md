## Theme : Future

### How is the theme implemented:

I made a beat'em up in a form in a survival game in apost apocalyptic world with robot charaters. The game mechanics may not be that well

### Project genesis:

Year 2023 has started. Let's make a game.

I wanna get good at making fighting games, I tried to make a versus fighting game, but that was too hard for me.  So I'll make a side scrolling beat'em up.
